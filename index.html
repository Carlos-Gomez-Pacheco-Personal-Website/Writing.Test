    Expect add(x, y) to return the sum of x and y Expect add(x, 0) to return x
    Expect add(0, y) to return y Expect add(x, y) to be commutative, meaning
    add(x, y) should be the same as add(y, x) Expect add(x, y) to be
    associative, meaning add(x, add(y, z)) should be the same as add(add(x, y),
    z) Expect add(x, y) to be distributive over addition, meaning add(x, add(y,
    z)) should be the same as add(add(x, y), add(x, z))) Expect add(x,y) to
    return NaN if either x or y is not a number Expect add(x, y) to return
    Infinity if one of the numbers is Infinity and the other is not So if we
    apply this reasoning to the multiply function, we can expect: Expect
    multiply(x, y) to return the product of x and y Expect multiply(x, 1) to
    return x Expect multiply(1, y) to return y Expect multiply(x, y) to be
    commutative, meaning multiply(x, y) should be the same as multiply(y, x)
    Expect multiply(x, y) to be associative, meaning multiply(x, multiply(y, z))
    should be the same as multiply(multiply(x, y), z) Expect multiply(x,y) to be
    distributive over multiplication, meaning multiply(x, multiply(y, z)) should
    be the same as multiply(multiply(x, y), multiply(x, z))) Expect multiply(x,
    y) to return NaN if either x or y is not a number Expect multiply(x, y) to
    return Infinity if one of the numbers is Infinity and the other is not
    Expect multiply(x, y) to return 0 if either x or y is 0 !-- This list
    provides a comprehensive set of expectations for the multiply function based
    on its --!
