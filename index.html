        Expect add(x, y) to return the sum of x and y <br />Expect add(x, 0) to
        return x <br />Expect add(0, y) to return y <br />Expect add(x, y) to be
        commutative, meaning add(x, y) should be the same as add(y, x)
        <br />Expect add(x, y) to be associative, meaning add(x, add(y, z))
        should be the same as add(add(x, y), z) <br />Expect add(x, y) to be
        distributive over addition, meaning add(x, add(y, z)) should be the same
        as add(add(x, y), add(x, z)) <br />Expect add(x,y) to return NaN if
        either x or y is not a number <br />Expect add(x, y) to return
        <br /><br />
        Infinity if one of the numbers is Infinity and the other is not So if we
        apply this reasoning to the multiply function, we can expect: <br />
        <br />Expect multiply(x, y) to return the product of x and y
        <br />Expect multiply(x, 1) to return x <br />Expect multiply(1, y) to
        return y <br />Expect multiply(x, y) to be commutative, meaning
        multiply(x, y) should be the same as multiply(y, x) <br />Expect
        multiply(x, y) to be associative, meaning multiply(x, multiply(y, z))
        should be the same as multiply(multiply(x, y), z) <br />Expect
        multiply(x,y) to be distributive over multiplication, meaning
        multiply(x, multiply(y, z)) should be the same as multiply(multiply(x,
        y), multiply(x, z)) <br />Expect multiply(x, y) to return NaN if either
        x or y is not a number <br />Expect multiply(x, y) to return Infinity if
        one of the numbers is Infinity and the other is not <br />Expect
        multiply(x, y) to return 0 if either x or y is 0 <br /><br />!-- This
        list provides a comprehensive set of expectations for the multiply
        function based on its --!
